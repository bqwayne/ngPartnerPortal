# VdlRadio
Radio buttons allow the user to select one option from a set. Use radio buttons for exclusive selection if you think that the user needs to see all available options side-by-side.

### Examples
A basic radio group would have the following markup.
```html
<vdl-radio-group>
  <vdl-radio-button value="option_1">1</vdl-radio-button>
  <vdl-radio-button value="option_2">2</vdl-radio-button>
</vdl-radio-group>
```

A dynamic example for use inside a form showing support for `[(ngModel)]`:
```html
<vdl-radio-group [(ngModel)]="chosenOption">
  <vdl-radio-button *ngFor="let o of options" [value]="o.value">
    {{o.label}}
  </vdl-radio-button>
</vdl-radio-group>
```

## `<vdl-radio-group>`
### Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `selected` | `VdlRadioButton` | The currently selected button. |
| `value` | `any` | The current value for this group. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Whether the group is disabled. |

When selection is changed, an event is emitted from the `change` EventEmitter property.

### Notes
The `vdl-radio-group` component has no button initially selected.

                                 If provided, this attribute takes precedence as the element's text alternative. |

When checked, an event is emitted from the `change` EventEmitter property.

### Notes
* The `vdl-radio-button` component by default uses the accent color from the theme palette.
