`<vdl-checkbox>` provides the same functionality as a native `<input type="checkbox">`
enhanced with Material Design styling and animations.

<!-- example(checkbox-overview) -->

### Checkbox label
The checkbox label is provided as the content to the `<vdl-checkbox>` element. The label can be 
positioned before or after the checkbox by setting the `labelPosition` property to `'before'` or
`'after'`.

The checkbox label, also, has a required indicator that is activated by adding the `required`
property to the checkbox

If you don't want the label to appear next to the checkbox, you can use 
[`aria-label`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-label) or 
[`aria-labelledby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-labelledby) to 
specify an appropriate label.

### Checkbox Hint
A checkbox hint can be added under the checkbox label by adding the `hintText` to the checkbox
and assigning it a value

### Checkbox Error Message
Same as populating the hint label, you would added the `errorText` property to the checkbox and
assign a value

### Checkbox Info Button
The info button allows for a popover to provide more information about the checkbox. To add a popover
to the checkbox embed 
`<vdl-popover-predefined popoverTitle="Popover Title Goes Here">HTML content</vdl-popover-predefined>`
within the checkbox tag

### Use with `@angular/forms`
`<vdl-checkbox>` is compatible with `@angular/forms` and supports both `FormsModule` 
and `ReactiveFormsModule`.

### Indeterminate state
`<vdl-checkbox>` supports an `indeterminate` state, similar to the native `<input type="checkbox">`.
While the `indeterminate` property of the checkbox is true, it will render as indeterminate 
regardless of the `checked` value. Any interaction with the checkbox by a user (i.e., clicking) will
remove the indeterminate state.
