# vdl_button

VDL buttons are HTML `<button>` or `<a>` tags enhanced with styling and animation to match the
[Veritas Design button spec](https://confluence.community.veritas.com/display/uxcommunity/Global+Button).

Users should employ a button element (`<button>`) when clicking triggers some action in the current
view *without navigating*. An anchor element (`<a>`) should be used when clicking *navigates*
the user to another URL. Depending on which element is used, the component will either be an
instance of `VdlButton` or `VdlAnchor`.


### Button types

There are six types of buttons:
 1. Primary buttons - `vdl-primary-button`
    * Rectangular button
    * filled background
 2. Secondary buttons - `vdl-secondary-button`
    * Rectangular button
    * white background
    * with border
 3. Tertiary buttons - `vdl-tertiary-button`
    * Rectangular button
    * white background
    * without border
 4. Icon buttons - `vdl-icon-button`
    * Circular button
    * Transparent background
    * 40 by 40 px
 5. Floating Action Buttons (FABs) - `vdl-fab`
    * Circular button
    * Defaults background to primary button color
    * 56 by 56 px
 6. Mini Floating Action Buttons (Mini FABs) - `vdl-mini-fab`
    * Circular button
    * Defaults background to primary button color
    * Box shadow applied
    * 40 by 40 px


Each is an attribute directive that you can add to a `button` tag.  You can provide custom content to the button by inserting it
between the tags, as you would with a normal button.

Example:

<!-- example(my example) -->

 ```html
<button vdl-primary-button>PRIMARY</button>
<button vdl-secondary-button>SECONDARY</button>
<button vdl-tertiary-button>TERTIARY</button>
<button vdl-fab>
    <vdl-icon class="vdl-24">add</vdl-icon>
</button>
<button vdl-mini-fab>
    <vdl-icon class="vdl-24">add</vdl-icon>
</button>
 ```

### Anchor types

There is, currently one type of anchor:
 1.  Anchor - `vdl-button`
    * Standard link button
    * Can be used inline with text

This is an attribute directive that you can add to an `a` tag. As with buttons, you can provide custom content to the
anchor by inserting it between the tags, as you would with a normal anchor tag.

### Button Sizes

In addition to the default size (for which nothing additional needs to be done), there are 3 other button sizes that can
be utilized: mini, small and large. These can be added to your class within your `button` or `a` tags respectively, by
adding, for example, `class='small'` to the tag.


<!-- example(my example) -->

```html
<button class='small' vdl-primary-button>go</button
```


### Disabling

You can disable any button type through the native `disabled` property.  You can add it directly, or bind it to a property on your
component class by adding `[disabled]="isDisabled"` given that the `isDisabled`
property exists.

```html
<button vdl-primary-button disabled>OFF</button>
<button vdl-secondary-button [disabled]="isDisabled">OFF</button>
<button vdl-tertiary-button [disabled]="isDisabled">OFF</button>
<button vdl-mini-fab [disabled]="isDisabled"><vdl-icon>check</vdl-icon></button>
```

Output:

### Accessibility

 * In high contrast mode, a strong border is added to the button to make it easier to see.
 * Button focus events originating from the keyboard will retain focus styles, while button focus events from the mouse will not.
 * As `vdl-button` is added to an existing `button` or `a` tag, it enjoys all the accessibility natively built into these elements.
