VDL Angular buttons are native `<button>` or `<a>` elements enhanced with Material Design 
styling.

<!-- example(button-overview) -->

Native `<button>` and `<a>` elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward
and accessible experience for users. A `<button>` element should be used whenever some _action_
is performed. An `<a>` element should be used whenever the user will _navigate_ to another view.


There are six button variants, each applied as an attribute:

| Attribute                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vdl-primary-button`        | Rectangular button filled                                                   |
| `vdl-secondary-button`      | Rectangular button white background with border                             |
| `vdl-tertiary-button`       | Rectangular button white background without border                          |
| `vdl-icon-button`           | Circular button with a transparent background, meant to contain an icon     |
| `vdl-fab`                   | Circular button                                                             |
| `vdl-mini-fab`              | Same as `vdl-fab` but smaller                                               |

There is one link <a> variant:

| Attribute                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vdl-button`                | Similar to tertiary button, but no padding or vertical alignment.           |
|                             | Can be used inline                                                          |

There are 3 additional predefined sizes for buttons, in addition to the default size: mini, small and 
large. To use these predefined sizes, add a `class='mini'` to your `<button>` or `<a>`.
Example:

```html
<button class='mini' vdl-primary-button>go</button
```
