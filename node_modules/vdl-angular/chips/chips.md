`<vdl-chip-list>` displays a list of values as individual, keyboard accessible, chips.

<!-- example(chips-overview) -->

_Note: chips are still early in their development and more features are being actively worked on._

```html
<vdl-chip-list>
  <vdl-chip>Papadum</vdl-chip>
  <vdl-chip>Naan</vdl-chip>
  <vdl-chip>Dal</vdl-chip>
</vdl-chip-list>
```

### Unstyled chips
By default, `<vdl-chip>` has Material Design styles applied. For a chip with no styles applied,
use `<vdl-basic-chip>`. You can then customize the chip appearance by adding your own CSS.

_Hint: `<vdl-basic-chip>` receives the `vdl-basic-chip` CSS class in addition to the `vdl-chip` class._

### Selection
Chips can be selected via the `selected` property. Selection can be disabled by setting
`selectable` to `false` on the `<vdl-chip-list>`.

Selection emits the `(select)` output while deselecting emits the `(deselect)` output. Both outputs
receive a ChipEvent object with a structure of `{ chip: alteredChip }`.

### Disabled chips
Individual chips may be disabled by applying the `disabled` attribute to the chip. When disabled,
chips are neither selectable nor focusable. Currently, disabled chips receive no special styling.

### Keyboard interaction
Users can move through the chips using the arrow keys and select/deselect them with the space. Chips
also gain focus when clicked, ensuring keyboard navigation starts at the appropriate chip.


### Theming
The selected color of an `<vdl-chip>` can be changed by using the `color` property. By default, chips
use a neutral background color based on the current theme (light or dark). This can be changed to 
`'primary'`, `'accent'`, or `'warn'`.
