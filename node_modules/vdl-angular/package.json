These\r\ncomponents will serve as an example of how to write Angular code following best practices. These\r\ncomponents will also conform to the Veritas Design Language.\r\n\r\n### What do we mean by \"high-quality\"?\r\n* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.\r\n* Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.\r\n* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.\r\n* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.\r\n* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.\r\n* Performance cost is minimized.\r\n* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular devs.\r\n\r\n## Browser and screen reader support\r\nAngular VDL supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:\r\nChrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge\r\n\r\nWe also aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:\r\n* NVDA and JAWS with IE / FF / Chrome (on Windows).\r\n* VoiceOver with Safari on iOS and Safari / Chrome on OSX.\r\n* TalkBack with Chrome on Android.\r\n",
