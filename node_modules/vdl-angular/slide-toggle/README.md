A basic slide-toggle would have the following markup.
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle [(ngModel)]="slideToggleModel">
  Default Slide Toggle
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```

Slide toggle can be also disabled.
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle disabled>
  Disabled Slide Toggle
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```

The `slide-toggle` can be also set to checked without a `ngModel`
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle [checked]="isChecked">
  Input Binding
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```

You may also want to listen on changes of the `slide-toggle`<br/>
The `slide-toggle` always emits the new value to the event binding `(change)`
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle (change)="printValue($event)">
  Prints Value on Change
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```

## Theming
A slide-toggle is default using the `accent` palette for its styling.

Modifying the color on a `slide-toggle` can be easily done, by using the following markup.
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle color="primary">
  Primary Slide Toggle
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```

The color can be also set dynamically by using a property binding.
```html
<vdl-slide-toggle [color]="myColor">
  Dynamic Color
</vdl-slide-toggle>
```
