`<vdl-sidenav-list>` is a panel that can be placed next to or above some primary content.
A page should only have one sidenav list that should appear on the left side (in LTR mode)
under the topbar element.

<!-- example(sidenav-overview) -->

The sidenav and its associated content live inside of an `<vdl-sidenav-container>`:
```html
<vdl-sidenav-list [selectedCategory]="selectedCategory"
                  [categoryList]="categoryItems"
                  (onCategorySelect)="categorySelected($event)">
</vdl-sidenav-list>
```

### Sidenav List Properties
The sidenav can render in one of three different ways based on the `mode` property.

| Property         | Description                                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| categoryList     | An array of `Category` objects defining the elements that will appear in the sidenav.     |
| selectedCategory | An instance `Category` should represents the currently selected category list item.       |

### Sidenav List Events
The sidenav can render in one of three different ways based on the `mode` property.

| Event            | Description                                                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onCategorySelect | The supplied function is called when the user either clicks or hits enter on a list item.  |

The `onCategorySelect` client function gets called whenever the user clicks on one of the list elements. It is up to the client
application to decide if it will change the route or otherwise update the `selectedCategory` property. The `onCategorySelect`
event will not be fired when the category has sub categories.

Clients are not restricted to a static set of categories. Categories can be added to the list or removed as the
application sees fit. Note that while this is possible, it may not be good UX. Please discuss dynamic changes
with your UX professional.

### Category Interface

The input to the sidenav list is an array of `Category` instances.

```js
export interface Category {
      id?: number;
      displayName: string;
      icon: string;
      route?: string;
      expanded?: boolean;
      subCategories?: Array<Category>;
```

Clients can extend or implement the `Category` class.

| Property      | Description
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | Numeric value to identify the category.
| displayName   | The text value to display for the category.
| icon          | String value for the icon to display. Currently works with font-awesome icons.
| route         | Not used by `sidenav-list` component, provided for application to simplify structure
| expanded      | Optional value for the expander state when a first level category has sub categories.
| subCategories | Optional array of sub categories. Only the first level of sub categories are honored.
