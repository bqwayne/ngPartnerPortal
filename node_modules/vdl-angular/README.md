### Installation

The latest release of Veritas Design Language can be installed using npm.

Add the following to your package.json:
`"vdl-angular": "git+https://git@stash.veritas.com/scm/vdl/vdl-angular-builds.git#<version EX: v1.0.0>",`

After the above has been added to your package.json you than need to run:
`npm install`

Add the following to your index.html:
`<link href="node_modules/vdl-angular/core/theming/prebuilt/vdl-global.css" rel="stylesheet">`
This styles things such as h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, body, html, etc...
Note*: this should go after a prebuilt theme if one is being utilized.

"Available" means that the components or feature is published and available for use.


Please let us know about issues or updates via Slack, Jira, or Email whatever works best for you!
We also really want this to become an open source community within Veritas so we hope you will
contribute yourself and would highly recommend this approach!

## The goal of Angular VDL
Our goal is to build a set of high-quality UI components built with Angular and TypeScript. These
components will serve as an example of how to write Angular code following best practices. These
components will also conform to the Veritas Design Language.

### What do we mean by "high-quality"?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular devs.

## Browser and screen reader support
Angular VDL supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge

We also aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* NVDA and JAWS with IE / FF / Chrome (on Windows).
* VoiceOver with Safari on iOS and Safari / Chrome on OSX.
* TalkBack with Chrome on Android.
