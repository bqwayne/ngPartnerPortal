`<vdl-input-container>` is a wrapper for native `input` and `textarea` elements. This container 
applies Material Design styles and behavior while still allowing direct access to the underlying
native element.

The native element wrapped by the `vdl-input-container` must be marked with the `vdlInput` directive.

### `input` and `textarea` attributes

All of the attributes that can be used with normal `input` and `textarea` elements can be used on
elements inside `vdl-input-container` as well. This includes Angular directives such as
`ngModel` and `formControl`.

The only limitations are that the `type` attribute can only be one of the values supported by
`vdl-input-container` and the native element cannot specify a `placeholder` attribute if the
`vdl-input-container` also contains a `vdl-placeholder` element. 

### Supported `input` types

The following [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) can
be used with `vdl-input-container`:
* date
* datetime-local
* email
* month
* number
* password
* search
* tel
* text
* time
* url
* week

### Placeholder

A placeholder for the input can be specified by using the `placeholder`
attribute on the `input` or `textarea`.

### Prefix and Suffix

HTML can be included before, and after the input tag, as prefix or suffix. It will be underlined as
per the Material specification, and clicking it will focus the input.

Adding the `vdlPrefix` attribute to an element inside the `vdl-input-container` will designate it as
the prefix. Similarly, adding `vdlSuffix` will designate it as the suffix.

### Hint text

Hint text are the labels that show below the underline on a `vdl-input-container`
